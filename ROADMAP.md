# winbox — known issues and roadmap

Everything currently known to be wrong, ranked. Each entry says what breaks,
how it was found, and what fixing it involves. Items are removed when fixed,
not ticked — `git log` is the record of what was done.

Ordering is risk × tractability, not severity alone: an unreproducible crash
outranks a typo on severity but cannot be worked on, and there is no value in
a roadmap whose top item nobody can start.

## Open

Nothing is currently queued. Items 1-8 have all been worked — `git log` is the
record. Item 8 is addressed at its source (below) but stays listed as
*Watching* because it is intermittent by nature.

One finding from the breakpoint work is worth keeping, because it shapes any
future kdbg change: **neither breakpoint mechanism installs on both images.**
Windows 11 runs HVCI by default, which exists precisely to stop the `0xCC`
patch a software breakpoint writes into a kernel code page, so `--mode soft`
cannot work there. Server 2022 has instead been seen exhausting the four
per-vCPU DR0..3 slots, which is the hardware path's ceiling. `--mode auto`
tries hardware first and falls back, so it works on both, and the failure
messages now name the wall you actually hit instead of guessing at one.

## Watching

### 8. The guest agent drops shortly after a reboot — addressed, watched

The shape: a command runs fine, and the *next* one — a few seconds later,
after a reboot earlier in the sequence — gets
`Guest agent is not responding: QEMU guest agent is not connected`. Seen
several times, usually the command right after a reboot (e.g. `autologin
status` after the AppLocker test's reboot). The channel comes up, answers
once, and drops again before it settles.

**Fixed at the source.** Readiness now reads libvirt's channel-state
attribute (`agent_channel_connected` in `vm/lifecycle.py`, consulted by
`GuestAgent.ping()`), and `reboot_and_wait` waits for several consecutive
channel-up reads rather than the first answered ping. libvirt is the
authority on channel state — the exact thing that flaps — so the gate reads
the drop directly instead of inferring it from a failed round-trip.

**Still Watching, not Closed**, because it is intermittent: a clean run does
not prove absence. The channel-state gate closes the window it was measured
in, but a sufficiently slow settle could still slip past a bounded wait.

**Do not "fix" the residue with a blanket retry.** Retrying a command that may
already have run in the guest is exactly what item 1's typed exceptions exist
to prevent. If more is needed, the only safe retry is a bounded one on
`GuestAgentUnreachable` for *read-only* operations — a deliberate decision,
not a reflex.

**If it recurs:** note what ran immediately before, whether a reboot happened
within the previous minute, and whether `vm.agent_connected()` reads
connected at that moment.

## Environment notes

* `/tmp` is a 16 GB tmpfs. Tests that write ISO-sized files fill it —
  `tests/test_iso.py` shrinks the profile floor to 4 KB for this reason.
* **Fixed at the source.** `pyproject.toml`'s `mcp` extra was unbounded
  (`mcp>=1.0`), so a plain reinstall could silently resolve to `mcp` 2.0.0,
  which dropped `mcp.server.fastmcp` — the import `winbox.mcp` relies on —
  and broke every `mcp`-dependent test with no warning until import time.
  Now pinned `mcp>=1.0,<2`. If a test run still fabricates `mcp`-import
  errors, the environment's Python has a stale/wrong `mcp` install outside
  this constraint (e.g. a system-wide `pip install mcp` from before this fix)
  — reinstall it (`pip install 'mcp>=1.0,<2'`) rather than chasing the
  symptom per-test.
